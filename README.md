## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Tim, a **mobile app developer** passionate about creating engaging and impactful applications.  
Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on building apps that combine **fitness, fun, and social features**.

### ðŸš€ Featured Project
**Kompii** â€“ a social fitness app that makes working out more fun and competitive.  
Available now on both platforms:

- [ðŸ“± Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/)  
- [ðŸ¤– Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/)

ðŸ’¡ On this GitHub, I mostly share **snippets, concepts, and demos** of my work rather than full codebases.  
If youâ€™d like to know more about my projects or code, feel free to reach out!
