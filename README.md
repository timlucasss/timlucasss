## Hi there 👋

I’m Tim, a **mobile app developer** passionate about creating engaging and impactful applications.  
Currently, I’m focusing on building apps that combine **fitness, fun, and social features**.

### 🚀 Featured Project
**Kompii** – a social fitness app that makes working out more fun and competitive.  
Available now on both platforms:

- [📱 Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kompii/id6475413819)  
- [🤖 Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rtkolabs.levelup&hl=en_GB)  

You can also learn more at my promotional website: [🌐 rtkolabs.com](https://rtkolabs.com)

💡 On this GitHub, I mostly share **snippets, concepts, and demos** of my work rather than full codebases.  
If you’d like to know more about my projects or code, feel free to reach out!
